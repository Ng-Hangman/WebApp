What is Hangman
=======

Traditional Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers,
within a certain number of guesses.
Now we bring to you the DIGITAL avatar of everybody’s favorite clue based pen and paper word guessing game!



How to play 
===================
The host will think of a word, phrase or sentence as a secret word. One or more players must solve the secret word within eight(8) tries.
Save the good old Hangman by correctly guessing the answer. Each incorrect attempt costs you a chance. 
You lose when you reach the maximum tries. So put on your thinking cap and get cracking! 
It’s not a simple word game; you hold a life in your hands, Mate !



Strategy
========

The twelve most commonly occurring letters are, in descending order: e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u. 

This and other letter-frequency lists are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess.

On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word which deliberately avoids common letters (e.g. rhythm or zephyr) or one that contains rare letters (e.g. jazz).

When you play this game, the best strategy is to guest vowel first.
