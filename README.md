HANGMAN
=======

Hangman is an educational classic word-guessing games or a puzzle for one or more players by picking the letter. 

It is originally from a paper and pencil guessing game. 

Scores will be added or subtracted depends on what letter you picked. 

It has the maximum letter of number for the wrong letters until you get it immediately. 

This game was built with HTML5.


STRATEGY
========

The twelve most commonly occurring letters are, in descending order: e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u. 

This and other letter-frequency lists are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess.

On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word which deliberately avoids

common letters (e.g. rhythm or zephyr) or one that contains rare letters (e.g. jazz).

When you play this game, the best strategy is to guest vowel first.
